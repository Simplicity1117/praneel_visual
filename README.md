(WorkInProgress) This is the barebore required to visualize the franka robot. It mainly uses joint_state_publisher and robot_state_publisher

This requires franka_description package to simulate the robot. If you have the franka_ros installed then nothing to worry about.

Just download this folder inside the src of your work_space. 
as ~/catkin_ws/src

~/catkin_ws/src cd..
~/catkin_ws catkin_make

Once the instliation is complete 

~/catkin_ws roslaunch praneel_visual praneel_visual.launch
